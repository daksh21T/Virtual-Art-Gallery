        With this monumental painting, Samuel F. B. Morse wanted to glorify US
        democracy in action. He depicts the grand House of Representatives
        chamber glowing in lamplight before an evening session. The artist spent
        four months in Washington painting the individuals seen here:
        congressmen, staff, Supreme Court justices, and press. At the far right
        in the visitors’ gallery is Chief Petalesharo (Pawnee Nation), who
        visited President James Monroe in 1821. Petalesharo is isolated from the
        other figures, echoing the oppression and displacement of Native
        Americans. Morse toured the painting...

        What’s in your he(art)? Watch Orville the Poet, a Maryland-based spoken
        word artist, perform an original poem titled “Between the Lines” in
        front of the poem’s inspiration, Theaster Gates’s Ground Rules (black
        line). As part of Gates’s Ground Rules series, Ground Rules (black line)
        repurposes gymnasium floors from decommissioned Chicago high schools,
        exploring themes of community preservation, access, and social order.
        Inspired by Gates’s work, Orville the Poet bridges the worlds of visual
        art and poetry. On Saturday, September 23rd, 2023, celebrated poets from
        across the nation came together for “Poetry is a country” to read
        original poetry inspired by works in our collection.

        During the last fifteen years of his life Matisse developed his final
        artistic triumph by "cutting into color." First, his studio assistants
        would brush opaque and semi-transparent watercolor pigments onto small
        sheets of white paper. The artist would then cut the sheets freehand in
        bold shapes that would be pinned to the white studio walls, adjusted,
        recut, combined and recombined with other elements. Later, the elements
        were glued flat to large white paper backgrounds for shipping or
        display.

        Joseph Mallord William Turner excelled at capturing the beauty and
        mysteries of light. Cool, white moonlight contrasts with warm, yellow
        and orange firelight. Shimmering reflections animate the water’s still
        surface. The setting is the port of Newcastle, England, where coal from
        inland mines is being loaded onto ships. Coal was used to fuel the
        factories, mills, railroads, steamships, and other great machines that
        were transforming Britain during the Industrial Revolution. The dark
        smoke rising on the right may refer to the increasing air pollution.

        Born in 1967 in Albuquerque, NM, Leo Villareal began experimenting with
        light, sound, and video while studying set design and sculpture at Yale
        University, where he received his BA. He then studied new media and
        computing at New York University’s interactive telecommunications
        program at the Tisch School of the Arts. He also learned the programming
        skills that enabled him to push LED technology past familiar commercial
        applications Since the 1960s, a growing number of artworks have
        exploited light to frame and create spaces in the built environment....
